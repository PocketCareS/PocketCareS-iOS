## How does PocketCare S Work?

You can read more about how the server works here.

1. PocketCare S uses Bluetooth LE technology to scan and send packets called beacons. 
2. PocketCare S uses the iBeacon layout for the beacon format in order to work with the iOS version.
3. As soon as PocketCare S starts with the required permissions, it starts scanning for iBeacons in a regular interval (every minute) and transmitting iBeacons continuously.
4. When PocketCare S detects a beacon nearby, it starts a session.
